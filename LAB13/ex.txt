Implement a software application that makes DNA patterns from DNA sequences of gene promoters. Compute the C+G% and the Kappa Index of Coincidence values from each sliding window.

To ensure that the algorithm implementation works correctly, use the following steps:

1. Use the sequence: S=“CGGACTGATCTATCTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACGTAGCATCTATCGATCTATCTAGCGATCTATCTACTACG”.

2. Use a sliding window of length 30b.

3. Build a function to process the CpG content. The value that the function must return is: CG = 29.27

4. Build a function to process the Index of Coincidence. The value that the function must return is: IC = 27.53 

5. Plot the pattern on a chart.

6. Calculate the center of weight of the pattern.
7. Take the center of each pattern and plot it on a second chart.

8. Take the DNA sequence of a promoter and generate a pattern. Open PromKappa and see if your pattern is the same.

Download from Moodle the fasta file containing promoter sequences and use it as an input for an updated application
 which is able to generate and save 
the objective digital stain inside a folder.
The promoter file can be found inside the PromKappa package.
