1. Take an arbitrary DNA sequence from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology), between 1000 and 3000 nucleotides (letters).

2. Implement a software application that detects repetitions (between 6b and 10b) in this DNA sequence.

3. Plot the frequencies of the found repetitions.

4. Download 10 influenza genomes. For each, plot the frequencies of found repetitions.
