1. Take an arbitrary DNA sequence from NCBI between 1000-3000 nucleotides (letters)
a. Take 2000 random samples from this sequence, of about 100-150 bases.
b. store these samples in an array or list
c. rebuild the original DNA sequence using these random samples
d. Make a text file called answer.txt in which you explain what will be the main issue with the algorithm approach
