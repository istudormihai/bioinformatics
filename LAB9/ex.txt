1. Make an artificial DNA sequence of 200-400b in length, in which to simulate 3-4 transposable elements.

2. Implement a software application to detect the positions of these transposable elements (start, end)
within the created DNA sequence.

3. Download from NCBI 3 bacterial genomes of your choosing. Try to find in these genomes possible tranposons.
For these, one must detect possible inverted repeats without prior knowledge about their existence in the sequence.
The inverted repeat should have 4 minimum length of 4 letters and a maximum of 6 letters.

4. Make a raport about the results from exercise 3 write the raport in a txt or docx file. Upload this raport on moodle.
