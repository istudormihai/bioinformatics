1. The melting temperature (Tm) is the temperature at which one-half of a particular DNA duplex will dissociate and become a single strand of DNA. Primer length and sequence are of critical importance in designing the parameters of a successful amplification. The melting temperature of a nucleic acid duplex increases both with its length, and with increasing GC content. A simple formula for calculation of the (Tm) is:  Tm = 4(G + C) + 2(A + T) °C

The actual Tm is influenced by the concentration of Mg2+ , K+ , and cosolvents. An alternative formula is:

Tm = 81.5 + 16.6(log10([Na+])) + .41*(%GC) – 600/length



Implement an application that calculates the melting temperature of a DNA sequence using one of these formulas or both.

Input = a string of DNA

Output = temperature in celsius

2. Design an application that uses the slidding window method in order to read the melting temperature (Tm) over the sequence S.
Use a sliding window of 8 positions. And choose a FASTA file as input.
