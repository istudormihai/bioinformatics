Implement an app that converts the coding region of a gene into an amino acid sequence. Use the genetic code table .

Download from NCBI the FASTA files containing the COVID19 genome and the INFLUENZA genome. Use the artificial intelligence
to compare the codon frequencies between the two. 
a. Make a chart that shows the top 10 most frequent codons for COVID 19
b. Make a chart that shows the top 10 most frequent codons for Influenza
c. Compare the two results and show the most frequent codons between the two genomes.
d. Show in the output of the console the top 3 aminoacids for each genome.
